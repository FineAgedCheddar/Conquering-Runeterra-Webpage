## Notes

This project was really fun to make and honestly it wasn't that difficult! I think the biggest challenge I experienced while creating my page was managing all the CSS for my elements and getting a search bar from a seperate component to share the word the user searched with my component with the database list in it. Other than that, I felt this project was a great way to wrap up the class and put everything we learned to use.
